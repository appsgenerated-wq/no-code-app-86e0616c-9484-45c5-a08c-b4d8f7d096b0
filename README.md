# Project Newton: LunarMonkeys

Welcome to the mission control for Project Newton. This application is a full-stack solution built with React and Manifest for tracking our primate astronauts and their scientific discoveries on the moon.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access**: Log in as a 'Scientist' to manage primates and discoveries, or as an 'Observer' for read-only access.
- **Astro-Primate Management**: Scientists can add new primates, upload their avatars, and update their mission status.
- **Discovery Logging**: Log new scientific findings, categorize their importance, link them to the discovering primate, and upload proof documents.
- **Dynamic UI**: The interface is built with React and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and modern user experience.
- **Manifest Backend**: The entire backend is powered by Manifest, providing a secure API, database, file storage, and authentication out of the box.
